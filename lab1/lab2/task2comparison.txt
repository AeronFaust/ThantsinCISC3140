Working with makefile to compile and run Java program is a lot
more seamless compared to bash. It is a lot easier to edit and
a lot less programming knowledge is required to run it, provided
proper documentation is put in place for the makefile. It is much
more simple to extract file name from a file in make compared to
bash and it is even more simplier to replace file extensions. Make 
targets are practically bash functions. Overall, operating a
makefile and working with file redirection on it is a lot more 
simple in comparison to bash.
