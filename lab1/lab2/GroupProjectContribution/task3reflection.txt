If someone else were to replicate our group's process using
the same tool, they should get a firm understanding of regex
in awk as it makes the process so much more smooth.

Our group initially consisted of myself, Tahir, Rami, Jon and Peter
In terms of the group, communication was great as everyone
openly communicated about what they are having trouble on and
what they need help with. We first assigned 1 query program to 
each member of the group to get 5 awk programs at the end but
unfortunately Peter's mother has passed away during the project
so he was unable to work with us. We moved onto 4 person group, 
Rami worked on the first program and me and Tahir worked on the
other four programs together, leaving Jon with the presentation
making. We had no scheduling issues as we just worked on it during 
our free time and it happens that they aligned.
